03 JavaScript: Password Generator
We were tasked to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app is expected to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It should also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
